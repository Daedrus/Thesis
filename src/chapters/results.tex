\section{Test program description}
\label{section:testprogram}

In order to create a test program for the above methods we have to determine the requirements for such a program. Since we are interested determining allocation sizes and allocation points, the test program has to provide a sufficiently diverse combination of these. Our program also has to be deterministic so that we test the methods against the same sequence of allocations. The number of allocations has to be sufficiently high so that the overhead of monitoring becomes noticeable.
